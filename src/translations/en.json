The project focused on ensuring educational continuity for primary and secondary school students in seven curricular areas (Mathematics, Communication, Science, etc.) during the pandemic. To maximize engagement and learning, gamification was used in the educational environment, allowing students to learn through play. The main technical challenge was offline-first development for tablets, intended for areas without internet access. This required the design of a robust local grade storage system and a master application for teachers, which connected to the student tablet to automatically collect progress and grade files.",
